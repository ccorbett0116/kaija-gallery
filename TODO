left/right buttons sometimes too tall/small on rotated media
controls are on side rather than bottom when a player is rotated
left button shouldnt appear on first media
right button shouldn't appear on last media
Dropdown shouldnt find fields already used in dateEdit Date page light mode
Investigate jump to date functionality (should query for which media is most recent (date, then fallback to upload date) to that day (x), and jump to the highest multiple of num columns (y) s.t. y<x)
Add jump to date on timeline

Verify mobile UI's (especially date pickers/upload media)
