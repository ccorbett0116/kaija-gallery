If video is already an mp4, dont transcode
Dropdown shouldnt find fields already used in dateEdit Date page light mode
Investigate jump to date functionality (should query for which media is most recent (date, then fallback to upload date) to that day (x), and jump to the highest multiple of num columns (y) s.t. y<x)
Add jump to date on timeline

Verify mobile UI's (especially date pickers/upload media)
